Low-Pass Filtering (Blurring)
The most basic of filtering operations is called "low-pass". 
A low-pass filter, also called a "blurring" or "smoothing" filter, averages out rapid changes in intensity. 
The simplest low-pass filter just calculates the average of a pixel and all of its eight immediate neighbors. 
The result replaces the original value of the pixel. 
The process is repeated for every pixel in the image.

What are the features/clues/Artifacts that are used to distinguish Normal and Abnormal
======================================================================================
1. Consolidation : Ill/BAd defined opacity.
2. Positive Silhouette Sign(Inability to differentiate closed Structures).
e.g: heart and lung having almost the same density i.e contrast is very low.
3. Lungs having the same density with abdominal organs.
4. Air bronchogram in normal state should not be visible Through the lungs but with pneumonia you can see it.
5. Pteural effusion : Liguid is Lungs Cavity. Normally there are no liquid in lungs.
6. Not seeing Lungs edges , Normal edges should be clear and sharp.
7. Abscess: Mass(space occupying region) or cavitations.

I. Consolidation:
1. Ill defined opacity.
2. Air bronchogram in normal state should not be visible Through the lungs but with pneumonia you can see it.
2. Positive Silhouette Sign(Inability to differentiate closed Structures).
